# ATN Project 1

I am assuming that the machine has Java 8, and Maven already installed.


## Running the Project
1. Download the complete maven project and unzip it.
2. Inside the project folder run the below commands to create a uber(fat) jar.
```shell
mvn clean install 
```
3. After this, the fat jar is generated in the `/target` folder.
4. To run the application, use the below commands
```shell
java -jar target/uber-atn-project1-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
